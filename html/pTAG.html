      HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard
      markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript,
      HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually
      engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
      interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML
      files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation,
      making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

      HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images
      and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It
      provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
      semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
      other items.

      The language is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags
      enclosed in angle brackets . Browsers do not display the HTML tags and
      scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
